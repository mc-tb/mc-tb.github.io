        <h1 class="subtitle">Meridian Concepts:<br /> Over 30 Years of Expertise in Distressed Properties</h1>
        <p class="text">Since the early 1990s, Meridian Concepts has specialized in construction
            project management and development, focusing on distressed real estate projects with various challenges.
        </p>
        <p class="text">Our portfolio includes projects ranging from $20 million to $100 million in
            asset value. These projects often faced significant issues, including cost overruns, construction losses,
            delays in sales and leasing, and difficulties in meeting
            debt service obligations.</p>
        <h2 class="left-header">Our Mission and Approach</h2>
        <p class="text">At Meridian, our primary mission is to identify and resolve
            the critical challenges of distressed projects. When engaged, we conduct a
            comprehensive audit to assess the project’s condition and implement tailored
            solutions. This includes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="text">Eliminating Cost Overruns: Identifying inefficiencies and re-aligning budgets to control
                expenses.</li>
            <li class="text">Injecting Capital: Providing or facilitating necessary funding to address immediate
                financial needs.</li>
            <li class="text">Meeting Milestones: Accelerating construction progress to achieve critical goals, including
                obtaining certificates of occupancy. </li>
            <li class="text">Enhancing Marketing and Leasing: Collaborating with marketing teams to drive property sales
                and increase tenant occupancy.</li>
